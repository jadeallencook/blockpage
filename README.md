# Blockpage

The web tool that bridges design and development using the latest technologies.

## Getting Started

Generate a new project by running `npx blockpage project-name`.

Start your development environment by running `yarn serve`.

## Dashboard Features

- Edit blocks that are in Storybook component explorer.
- Mange pages that are built using blocks within Storybook.
- Configure the React router using pages.
- Adjust style and project global settings.

## Developer's Guide

At the highest level there are only two steps:

1. Generate React & Storybook boilerplates.
1. Initalize Blockpage dashboard.

You can test your changes by using these commands:

- **yarn start** - generate boilerplates and initialize dashboard.
- **yarn clean** - removes directories for old boilerplates.
- **yarn update** - updates boilerplates using update script
- **yarn build** - overwrites boilplate using build script.
- **yarn serve** - serves blockpage dashboard and boilerplates.
